Therefore, you can correct only a few characters of your first, middle, and last name.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>A passenger is allowed to correct a name up to four characters.

Southwest Airlines permits a person to change the name after marriage only on the submission of legal documents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that in the case of marriage or divorce, a passenger is only allowed to correct the last name. The following documents are needed at the time of name correction on tickets:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>In the event of a marriage, a traveler has to provide a marriage license, previous identity proof, and existing identification proof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>In the case of divorce, a passenger must submit court orders and documents supporting a legal name change.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ways of Name Correction on the Tickets of Southwest Airlines</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every passenger uses different methods for solving their misspelled errors on the tickets. For this, Southwest Airlines has provided distinct ways of correcting the name. So, a passenger can change the name on the ticket in the following ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 1 - Name Change by Calling the Airlines</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every airline provides contact information to passengers that they can use anytime. Most customers use these details to modify the name on the ticket. After you call the customer service number, follow the given steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You must have your six-digit booking number.</li>\r\n	<li>Submit photocopies of legal documents or any other information that depicts your correct identity when asked by the representative.</li>\r\n	<li>You can only add up to four characters in total to your first, middle, and last name.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>If there is any fee alongside the fare difference to be paid, you must pay that.</li>\r\n	<li>After the&nbsp;<strong>name change on the boarding pass</strong>, you will get a new confirmation. Next, you need to complete the check-in and seat selection again.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 2 - Name Correction by Using Website</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A customer can use the Southwest Airlines website to alter the name on the ticket. If you want to use this method for rectifying the name on Southwest Airlines, you need to go along with the following steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First, stop by the official site of the airline.</li>\r\n	<li>Second, click on the &ldquo;log in&rdquo; icon.</li>\r\n	<li>Third, fill in your confirmation number and last name.</li>\r\n	<li>Fourth, click on the flight button.</li>\r\n	<li>Fifth, select &ldquo;manage reservation&rdquo; from the menu.</li>\r\n	<li>Sixth, you will get on the scheduled reservation table, where you will get an option of &ldquo;Edit Name&rdquo;. Edit your name and enter all the relevant information regarding the name change.</li>\r\n	<li>Seventh, you will pay the fee, if applicable.</li>\r\n	<li>Lastly, save all the information and wait for the confirmation of the new ticket.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 3 - Name Change on the Ticket Via Compliant Page</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The compliant page is the unique feature of Southwest Airlines name change policy. It informs the airline about a passenger&rsquo;s complaints and can be used for placing requests.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the steps to use this method for name correction:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First, visit the contact us page on Southwest Airlines&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.southwest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>Second, use the Email Us option given on the page.</li>\r\n	<li>Third, fill the form with the necessary details, like flight particulars.</li>\r\n	<li>Fourth, upload the relevant documents in support of the name change.</li>\r\n	<li>Lastly, wait for the response that you may receive on your email ID.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Southwest Airlines Name Change Charges</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The name change fee depends on the situation under which the request is initiated. If a passenger has started the&nbsp;<strong>name correction on the ticket</strong> request within 24 hours, there is no need to pay any change fee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you have requested the name correction after 24 hours of booking, you may have to pay between $80-$200. The fee amount is calculated depending on the date of change and the time left for boarding the flight.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the name correction, the ticket will be re-issued in the same available or higher class. If the ticket is rebooked in the higher class of service, then you will also have to pay the fare difference.&nbsp;</p>', '921262.webp', NULL, '2022-10-31 18:21:28'),

You can choose any of the following methods for&nbsp;<strong>name correction on the reservation</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 1 - Change Name Via Alaska Airlines Website</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the website for changing the name is the simplest way. You can use this method online to correct minor errors in spelling. You must accompany the following steps to proceed with the name corrections under this method:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Visit the Alaska Airlines official <a href=\"https://www.alaskaair.com/\" target=\"_blank\">site</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>Next, tap the &ldquo;Manage Booking&rdquo; option on the home page.</li>\r\n	<li>Fill in the necessary details like Passenger&rsquo;s Last Name, Confirmation Code, and E-ticket number.</li>\r\n	<li>Tap on the &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; button.</li>\r\n	<li>The complete booking details will be open in front of you.</li>\r\n	<li>Follow the &ldquo;Change Name&rdquo; option and make the necessary corrections in the name.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Lastly, print the ticket with the correct initials.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot change more than three characters in your name through this online method.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few conditions that you must satisfy to be able to change the name through the online method. You must adhere to the following requirements given under the Alaska Airlines name change policy for making corrections:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A passenger&rsquo;s ticket must be brought with Alaska Airlines directly, not through a travel agency or any other source.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>The ticket must not include any discounts or government offers.</li>\r\n	<li>The reservation should not be a group ticket.

Only&nbsp;<strong>name corrections of general reservations</strong> are acceptable.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 2 - Change Name Via Customer Care</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are less aware of the online procedure, you can use the traditional mode of modifying the name on the ticket. Alaska Airlines offers a convenient means for correcting the name on the ticket. In this method, you can contact the customer care representatives of Alaska Airlines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The customer care number will connect you with the agents of Alaska Airlines. Once you get in touch with the airlines, you will mention the reason for contacting them. If you want to change the name, you must tell the correct purpose, like marriage or divorce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, provide the necessary details about your reservation, including the travel date, aircraft number, and boarding pass details. The agent will confirm your information and proceed with the name change process. This method is also best for making last minutes changes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 3 - Change Name Via Airport Kiosk</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another mode of&nbsp;<strong>name corrections on the ticket</strong> is by using Airport Kiosk. The Kiosk is a self-service device that allows passengers to perform various activities. With the help of the Kiosk, you can print boarding passes, upgrade seating options, and modify the name on the ticket.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The passenger can use this service at the airport. It allows a passenger to alter or change the name without following a tedious process:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You can click the &ldquo;Change Flights&rdquo; option on the Kiosk machine.</li>\r\n	<li>Then, open the flight itinerary.</li>\r\n	<li>Further, provide the essential details regarding the reservation.</li>\r\n	<li>Lastly, click on the name that you want to modify and enter the new name to finish the process.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This self-operated machine saves a lot of effort and makes the process simple. The Kiosk method is also the most reliable as it leaves no chance of errors. It is the most efficient method of&nbsp;<strong>name corrections on the reservation</strong> under Alaska Airlines as the airline officials confirm the name change themselves. Also, you can ask for assistance if you face any issues while operating the machine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Limitations of Alaska Airlines Name Change</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Alaska&#39;s name-change policy may not work for travelers. In such instances, a passenger should know the limitations before requesting the name change. Following are the limitations that you should be aware of before:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The passenger&rsquo;s name on the ticket should match the name on the government-issued identification card. If there is a mismatch between the names, then it may create trouble during boarding.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>If the name mentioned on the passport is incorrect, you should first rectify it. After that, you should request the&nbsp;<strong>name change on the boarding pass</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alaska Airlines Name Correction Fees</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Alaska Airlines name change policy may charge fees for allowing corrections or changes on the ticket. Although, you can avoid the costs if you make the changes within 24 hours of the ticket reservation. If you apply for a name change after 24 hours, you will be charged $125. The fees remain similar for every change or correction in the name.&nbsp;</p>', '799900.webp', NULL, '2022-10-31 18:22:16'),

They ease and accelerate the name change process to protect the customer&rsquo;s interest. Therefore, a passenger will not distress before requesting a change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here are the following conditions that you must satisfy to be allowed to do name correction on tickets</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Delta Airlines authorizes the change of the last name ensuing from marriage.</li>\r\n	<li>One can rectify the middle name on the ticket without modifying the surname.</li>\r\n	<li>Passenger can alter their nicknames to legal names on the Delta Airline ticket or boarding pass.</li>\r\n	<li>A traveler can carry out simple additions to a name without altering the whole name.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Name Change Correction Situations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, there cannot be any one situation based on which a passenger applies for a change of name on the ticket. For example, some want to alter their last name, while some may like to change their middle name. Hence, you must know all these situations to proceed appropriately according to your purpose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Delta Airlines - Name Change After Marriage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The name inconsistency arises due to marriage. It is a common problem among all women. After marriage, a woman&rsquo;s last name gets changed, which causes an issue during the flight boarding process. It is because their last name doesn&rsquo;t match their individual I&rsquo;d cards. However, they can produce some legal documents pertaining to their marriage. Further, a woman may apply for a&nbsp;<strong>change of surname on the ticket</strong> in the case of divorce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Delta Airlines - Middle Name Corrections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Middle name is not a mandatory field to fill. But if you fill it, make sure you mention it correctly. It means your middle name should match the name written on your government identification card. On the initiation of the change procedure, the agent will perform the following steps to ensure the correction of the name:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Look into the PNR to correct the name.</li>\r\n	<li>Incorporate an OSI message to advise that the&nbsp;<strong>name correction on the ticket</strong> is completed.</li>\r\n	<li>Lastly, the airline will issue a ticket in exchange. Further, you will not be able to make any more changes to flights and dates.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Delta Airlines - Last Name Additions and Corrections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before falling under any kind of complexion with the wrong name, make sure to avoid the differences in your name while comparing it with the name in the government ID. In case of modifying the surname, you should know the following few things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Delta Airlines allows customers to add only three characters to their last names.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>The name correction process will be the same as the middle name. However, the only change will be in the OSI notification.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Delta Airlines guests can add something to their last names without modifying the first name. For this, below are the essential guidelines:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If you want to&nbsp;<strong>add a name</strong> to your surname, then the procedure will be similar to that of a middle name. After the correction, the traveler can check out the name in the PNR.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>The guest will get a reissued ticket, and after its receipt, the guest cannot make any further rectifications.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Delta Airlines - Last &amp; First Name Reversed</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It sometimes happens that a passenger mistakenly writes the last name in place of the first name on the flight ticket and vice versa. If you want to amend this mistake, it is essential to follow the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flyingrules.com/name-change/delta-airlines-name-change-policy\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Delta Airlines Name Change</strong></a><strong> or Correction Policy</strong>. The reversed name change process is akin to the above correction procedures. Only the OSI message will be different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there are other reasons besides those mentioned above, a passenger can contact Delta Airlines directly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Methods of Changing the Name on Delta Airlines Ticket</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have made an error in your name while booking your flight, don&rsquo;t worry because there are different ways of correcting them. Delta Airlines has specified three ways of&nbsp;<strong>name corrections on tickets</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are the three ways in which a passenger can either change or correct their incorrect name on the ticket:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 1 - Name Change Through Delta Official Website</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most common ways of rectifying the name on the Delta ticket is through the official website. To know how it processes, check out the following steps that you have to go along with:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Visit the formal <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> of Delta Airlines.</li>\r\n	<li>Fill in all the booking details and sign in to your account.</li>\r\n	<li>Tap on the &ldquo;Manage My Travel&rdquo; icon.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Enter your Delta ticket info and press the search button.</li>\r\n	<li>It will take you to your Delta Airline ticket, in which you will want to make a name change.</li>\r\n	<li>Click on the ticket and open it.</li>\r\n	<li>Tap on the icon placed on the upper right side of your screen, and you will see the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; icon.</li>\r\n	<li>Press the Edit button.</li>\r\n	<li>Find the option to change your name.</li>\r\n	<li>Type the name and scroll down to save the changes.</li>\r\n	<li>Last, pay if needed.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once these steps are performed, you will receive an email or notification from the airline confirming your name change on the Delta ticket.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 2 - Flight Name Change Via Phone Call</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some travelers like to make rectifications through an official website, while others go for a more plausible mode to connect directly with officials. In this, the passenger contacts the airline&#39;s office through a phone call. The number given by the airline to connect with agents is {{PHONE_NUMBER}}.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you reach the agent, he will ask for the necessary details regarding your reservation, including your PNR or e-ticket number. Further, the agent will ask you about the reason for the change and other relevant information. Upon receipt of all the details, the agent will proceed with the name change process. You can either stay on the call until the name change request is confirmed or ask for a confirmation email.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Method 3 - Name Change at Airport Kiosk</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Delta Airlines name correction policy offers name rectification at the airport Kiosk. With the help of the airport Kiosk, you can alter your name on the reservation through a simple self-service device. If you face any difficulty using this service, you can seek assistance from airport officials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To change the name at the airport Kiosk, you can proceed with the following steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open the gadget and log in to your account through the airline&rsquo;s official website.</li>\r\n	<li>Fill in your e-ticket number.</li>\r\n	<li>Open the trip details page and follow the directions to reach the change name option.</li>\r\n	<li>Rectify the name on the Delta ticket.</li>\r\n	<li>Last, take a print of your new boarding pass.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The airport Kiosk device is quite simple to use and saves passengers from the trouble of going through a long process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Charges for Name Change Corrections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Delta Airlines allows a passenger to rectify his name within 24 hours free of cost. It means the traveler will not have to pay any fee for name correction within the first twenty-four hours of booking their reservations. After 24 hours, the customer will have to pay a fee. The charges may vary from $75-$500.&nbsp;</p>', '931517.webp', '2022-10-14 05:00:28', '2022-10-31 18:22:58'),

There are three categories under which a passenger can rectify the misspelled name.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are three types of name change policies under United Airlines:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Category 1 - Simple Modifications in a Name</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When the passenger&rsquo;s name is incorrect on the ticket, the standard procedure will be used to correct the name. According to the&nbsp;<strong>United Airlines name correction policy</strong>, simple mistakes on the reservation ticket don&rsquo;t require the burden of documentation. These alterations are limited to spelling errors or a few letter mistakes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of simple name modifications are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Correcting a typo error in the spelling of the name. For instance, altering the first name Charli to Charlie and the last name Mathwe to Mathew.</li>\r\n	<li>Making a modification in the name on the reservation to or from a nickname. For example, Ally to AL.</li>\r\n	<li>Rectifying the prefix or title on the ticket. For example, Miss to Mrs, Mr. to Dr.</li>\r\n	<li>Modifying the middle name on the boarding pass. For instance, Elizabeth Richard Smith to Elizabeth R. Smith.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Category 2 - Significant Alterations in a Name</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant changes in the name are generally those alterations where a passenger has to submit legal documents supporting the modification. These changes are more substantial in comparison to the simple ones. Significant changes often happen in the event of marriage or divorce, where you must disclose documents supporting your request.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the documents that a passenger must show for a legal name change:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>In the case of divorce, you must present the papers outlining the separation settlement.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>In the event of a marriage, you must show a legal document supporting the name change.</li>\r\n	<li>If you have changed your full name, you must show a government-issued document that includes your old and new information.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Category 3 - Affidavit with an Alternative Name</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It may happen that you don&rsquo;t have the legal documents to support your name change. In such a case, United Airlines name change policy allows a customer to alter the name by showing the affidavit with an alternative name. It means a passenger can&nbsp;<strong>replace the name on the ticket</strong> with the help of an affidavit. With the help of an affidavit, a traveler can also generate a photo ID copy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How to Change the Name on the Ticket under the United Airlines Name Correction Policy?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every passenger uses their convenience while applying for a change of name on the ticket.

Although United Airlines works hard to take care of its customers and bring them to their destinations, it sometimes fails. Usually, it happens due to unpredicted circumstances. In that case, United Airlines do its best to assist travelers in the best possible way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some types of canceled flights under the United Airlines flight&nbsp;<strong>cancellation policy</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.

It means your travel must not begin after December 31, 2022, and must complete within a year from the outbound travel date.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>The refund amount depends on several factors. For example, the refund for partially used tickets will be calculated on a prorated basis. Other tax and&nbsp;<strong>cancellation fee</strong>s will be applicable as per the rules.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>A passenger who purchased the air ticket by credit card will get the refund within 7 days. On the other hand, all other passengers will get the cancellation refund within 20 business days.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>The customer will get the refund back to the original form of payment.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>United Airlines Cancellation Fee</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>United Airlines will not charge any cancellation fee if it happens due to covid-19 restrictions. Other than that, a passenger will have to pay a cancellation fee. As per&nbsp;<strong>United Airlines cancellation policy</strong>, a customer with a basic economy ticket will not have to pay any cancellation fee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the passenger has non-refundable and&nbsp;<strong>refundable airline tickets</strong>, the fee will be $200 for domestic and $400 for international flights.

This type of name change includes rectifying the vital part of your name, middle name, or inverted name. The reason for a legal name change can be anything like marriage, divorce, and adoption. Such alterations mainly include additions or eliminations of the last names.&nbsp;</p><p>As a passenger of Hawaiian Airlines, you need to match the details on the boarding pass with your government-issued certificates. If the names don\'t match, you need to make&nbsp;<strong>name corrections on the ticket</strong> before your flight departure. Now, you must be wondering how you can make legal name changes on the reservation. For legal changes, you should take the help of offline mode.&nbsp;</p><p>You can call the customer service number of Hawaiian Airlines to request legal changes in the name. The process for a legal name change through offline mode will be the same as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hawaiian Airlines Name Correction Fee</h2><p>The name correction fee is not fixed. It depends on the factors like correction type, flight type, etc. If you have bought the ticket from a third-party website, then $25 is the approximate charge for a name change. However, the&nbsp;<strong>flight name change</strong> fee may fluctuate between $75-$250 depending on the fare type and destination. If you request a name change before the departure date, you may get a chance to reduce the fee.&nbsp;</p>', NULL, '2022-10-29 14:20:05', '2022-10-29 14:20:05');
